## Introduction:
I wasn't satisfied with the group project before, so I decided to remake it again in another way.

I decided to deploy this project on Vercel (cause it's free), this is the link: https://foodhub-nextjs.vercel.app/

I used Nextjs, PostgreSQL, and Typescript to help me finish this project.
